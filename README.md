To run any of these scripts you need to install the following python libraries: Levenshtein, bibtexparser, and beautifulsoup4.

Run any of the scripts create_media.py, create_presentations.py, or create_publications.py to create the markdown files for media, presentations, and publications, respectively. The markdown files are created using the .bib and .html files generated by Zotero. To run any of these scripts, you need to provide 3 parameters in the following order: the path of the HTML file, the path of the BIB file, and the path of the target directory for the markdown files. 
Example:
```
$ python create_publications.py ./zotero_output/SIMSSAPublications.html ./zotero_output/SIMSSAPublications.bib ./content/71-publications/
```
